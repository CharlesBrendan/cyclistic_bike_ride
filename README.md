**INTRODUCTION**

Cyclistic Bike_Share is a case study for the completion of the Google Analytics Professional Certificate. the case study aimed of the case study is the give hands-on experience to junior data analytics to follow the process of Data Analytics ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act to determine how different bike users use bikes differently.

**OVERVIEW**

About the Company (Cyclistic): Cyclistic launched the 2016 bike-sharing program and has seen its fleet increase to 5,824 bicycles with 692 stations across Chicago.

Cyclistic offers flexibility in its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Moreno the director believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. and believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Hence, set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members

I as the junior analyst on the team need to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

**ASK STAGE**

The following questions would help the future marketing program

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

**PREPARE STAGE**

Historical trip data was made available by Motivate International Inc., this project is licensed under the [license](https://github.com/CharlesBrendan/cyclistic_bike_ride/tree/main#:~:text=Inc.%20under%20this-,license,-.%20The%20Cyclistic%20bike). The Cyclistic bike data is public data and I have to select 12 months data starting from May 2021 to April 2022 for the analysis [Divvy Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) was downloaded here. After loading the data I looked at the structure of the data, and merged all the different month's data to have a single data called Twelve_Month_data.

**LIBRARIES USED FOR THE PROJECT**

python
SQL
pandas as pd
numpy as ny
matplotlib.pyplot as plt
seaborn as sns

**SHARE STAGE**

After the data has been analyzed it is shared using R and Tableau which enhances better visualization, understanding, and presentation. more Tableau viz can be viewed here.

**ACT STAGE**

The casual riders use bikes more than the annual members.

The annual members have almost constant usage of bikes throughout the week.

The bike usage by the users is highest during the summer period, especially in the month of May through September.

**RECOMMENDATION**

There should be a subsidy/priority for the annual members to encourage casual riders to become annual members. The stations with the most ride duration should be a top priority and more innovative and user-friendly bikes should be used for the annual members, this will also make the casual riders want an annual membership. Free day ride for the annual members can also entice the casual riders to be annual members
